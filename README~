The huehuehue tarpit was written in python because why the hell not, I'll probably do c later

hue is identical to brainfuck (for the moment) and is converted with the following table:

HUE = ]
hue = >
huE = <
hUe = +
hUE = -
Hue = .
HuE = ,
HUe = [

the BFtHUE.py file converts bf to hue
neither whitespace or organization of any kind matters
comments are made with # because I like that thing
